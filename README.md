# Weekly-Report-Python

The goal of this project is to automate the creation of a weekly report that is currently being built manually in Excel. By using the powerful data manipulation capabilities of the pandas library in Python, this project aims to streamline the report creation process and reduce the potential for errors. This will involve importing relevant data into a pandas dataframe, performing various data transformations and cleaning operations, and finally generating the report in an appropriate format (e.g. CSV, Excel, PDF).

In addition to the standard data manipulation and reporting capabilities of pandas, this project may also involve utilizing other Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for data visualization and statistical analysis. This will allow to extract insights and trends from the data, and present them in a clear and visually appealing way in the final report. Additionally, this project aims to improve the overall flexibility and scalability of the weekly report by allowing for easy modification and customization of the report layout, data sources, and analysis methods. As new data sources become available or new insights are identified, the project can be easily updated to incorporate this information and provide a more comprehensive view of the data. 

This project is also expected to be updated and improved over time, as I will work to clean and optimize the code, add new features and functionalities, and test the performance of the script. I am also open to any suggestions and feedback that will improve the overall quality of the project. However, it should be noted that, for security reasons, the code provided in this project will only include small snippets of information, and certain sensitive data will be removed or replaced with dummy values.
